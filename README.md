CongS Inventory Application: 
The CongS inventory application was developed to streamline inventory management for small/large businesses or individual users.
The primary goal was to allow users to easily add, update, delete, and view items in their inventory, addressing the need for a 
simple, intuitive tool to track stock levels and item details without relyig on other complex system, spreadsheets, or manual inventory count.
To meet user needs, I needed to implement key screens such as a Add/Edit item screens with form validation or even detail view for item-
specific information. The UI was designed with clarity and accessibility in mind-
minimalist layouts, readable fonts, and intuitive navigation. I also had to priortize modularity and user flow, ensuring that each screen served a 
clear purpose.  I had some success with implementing the layout for each screen, minimizing struggle through navigation. I was unsuccessful with 
executing the actual application to due to constant errors on a couple screens. I approached the development with modular design principles,
breaking down the app into manageable components. For example, I used RecyclerView for dynamic item lists. That stratgies helped me stay organized
and made somewhat debugging easier. (lol) In the future, I'll continue applying modularity and clean arcgitecture to scale apps efficiently
and improve collaboration. When it comes to testing & debugging, I can say cold heartly that I will need ADDITIONAL support to understand where I am 
going wrong with my codes. Testing is crucial, while that is true, it has taught me the importance of validating user input and handling exceptions
gracefully to prevent crashes and ensure a smooth user experience.  One of the major challenges was rebuilding the app after deleting my original
and starting over. I had to rethink the structure, refactor code, and reimplement features under time pressure. The taught me resilience and the 
the value of iterative development. I am proud of how resilient I was about deleting and rebuilding my application after so many errors and using Kotlin language.
Certain components showcased my ability to apply best practices, maintain clean structure ( in the beginning), and deliver a functional,  user-friendly experience.
My growth reflection will be slow and upcoming, my growth reflection will demostrate my commitment to building tools that will empower users.
